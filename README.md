# BGG Rating Tracker

This is small Django app that is using Board Game Geek API in order to track and visualise Board Game Geek rating for selected games, as well as to send weekly and monthly reports for any changes in the rating.

It was intentended to use as an internal tool in my company and it's not polished 100%.
